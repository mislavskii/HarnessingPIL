# Playing with PILlow
Wrangling an image using the power of Python Image Library. 

There is a Jupiter notebook (cSheetShowcase.ipynb) and two files it needs to run.

Well, in fact it can even run without any additional files as long as you are connected to the Internet. Give it a try :)

Just as an exercise.
